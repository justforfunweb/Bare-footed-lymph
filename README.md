# Forking this repository (Guide)

Propose changes to someone else's project.
For example, you can use forks to propose 
changes related to fixing a bug. 
Rather than logging an issue for a bug you have 
found, you can:

- Fork the repository.
- Make the fix.
- Submit a pull request to the project owner.

### Prerequisites
If you haven't yet, 
first set up Git and authentication 
with GitHub.com from Git.
If you need more help try to [set up Git.](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)


### Forking the repository

You might fork a project to propose changes to the
upstream repository. In this case, it's good 
practice to regularly sync your fork with the upstream 
repository. To do this, you'll need to use Git on the 
command line. You can practice setting the upstream 
repository using the same [shubanms/Bare-footed-lymph](https://github.com/shubanms/Bare-footed-lymph)
repository you just forked.


1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the [shubanms/Bare-footed-lymph](https://github.com/shubanms/Bare-footed-lymph) repository.
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.

3. Select an owner for the forked repository.
4. By default, forks are named the same as their upstream repositories. You can change the name of the fork to distinguish it further.
5. Optionally, add a description of your fork.
6. Choose whether to copy only the default branch or all branches to the new fork. For many forking scenarios, such as contributing to open-source projects, you only need to copy the default branch. By default, only the default branch is copied.
7. Click Create fork.

### Cloning your forked repository

Right now, you have a fork of the [shubanms/Bare-footed-lymph](https://github.com/shubanms/Bare-footed-lymph) repository, but you do not have the files in that repository locally on your computer.
